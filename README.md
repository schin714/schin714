ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Drew Schineller
- Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer specializing in both application and web development. I've been working in the Warehouse Automation / Autonomous Robot space professionally for the past 3 years.
- In my free time I've been developing a web application/game for the past 1.5 years. This app is using Svelte, SvelteKit and Typescript. I use Supabase as the database and Vercel for deployment and the server of edge functions.
- I'm extremely passionate about all things in the technology space and am constantly seeking new areas to learn, grow and create unique and beatiful applications.
